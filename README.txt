ยง 2. What are Open Enumerations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open Enumerations as defined in the GLUE2 Model document:

   [1] http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.147.pdf

are special strings that are used to identify technologies and features
in the GLUE2 world. Each open enumeration must be lowercase and
must come with a description.

GLUE2 model defines some of them in Appendix B. In this repository,
the GLUE2 WG will maintain all those that are added by who wants
to use the GLUE2 model, so that they can be used for validation.

In a first release, these open enumerations will be presented in the
CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, but more elaborated formats might 
follow upon request.
